[Conway's Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
implemented in rust as a cli program. Implemented over about a days worth of work as a fun little project while I was on vacation.

### Running
The size of your terminal on start determines how large the board is, so I recommend making
the text in your terminal very small before running it.

Like any other rust program, start it by simply running `cargo run`
